VideoPlayer

Ok, it's a speedhack now, so i didn't named all in CC namespace, and i don't know if it needed, but feel free to open issues, pull requests, or simply comment what do you need.

Also, no documentation now, but i will add it later.
In a fact it's pretty simple to know how to use it - just look at commit history - i started from simple cocos2d 1.0 templates, and added VideoPlayer to it.

Only one class of Cocos2D needs to be changed to support keyboard video cancellation on Mac - MacGLView. See commit history for details - it's pretty easy, IMHO.

This repo includes mac and iOS XCode project files - they are demonstrations, how to use VideoPlayer.

VideoPlayer by itself is located in VideoPlayer folder.
To link it you need MediaPlayer.framework for iOS & QTKit for Mac

It should work ok on iOS starting from 2.2.1
On Mac it was tested on 10.6.6 and 10.6.7

OK, it's 5:14 here and i really need to sleep now, hope this repo will help better than first posts on cocos2d forumt. BTW it's located here:

Cheers!
